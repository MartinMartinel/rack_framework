## Rack Framework

This is a very simple rack framework. All it currently does is

  - Configure route rules using a simple DSL (Ruby on Rails style)
  - Route to the correct controller and call the respective action
  - Return a rack response


### Todos
- [ ] make the framework more "opinionated"
- [ ] add views that get rendered automatically
- [ ] create my own lightweight ORM
- [ ] improve my route rules DSL to support more complex paths
- [ ] autoload controllers under a namespace
- [ ] consider abstracting this framework into a gem
- [ [ use Rack Request and Response objects
